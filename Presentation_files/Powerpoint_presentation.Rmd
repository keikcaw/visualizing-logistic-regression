# Logistic regression review

---
# Logistic regression: Binary outcomes

- Use logistic regression to model a binary outcome

--

- Examples from higher education:

--

  - Did the student pass the class?

--

  - Did the student enroll for another term?

--

  - Did the student graduate?

---

# The design of logistic regression

- We want to model the probability that the outcome happened

--

- But probabilities are bounded between 0 and 1

--

- Instead, we model the logit of the probability:

$$
\mbox{logit}(p) = \log\left(\begin{array}{c}\frac{p}{1 - p}\end{array}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n
$$

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# What's the problem?

---

layout: true

# Just tell me "the" effect

- Stakeholders often want to know whether something affects outcomes, and by how much

---

--

- But we don't model probabilities directly

$$
\log\left(\begin{array}{c}\frac{p}{1 - p}\end{array}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n
$$

---

- But we don't model probabilities directly

$$
\boxed{\log\left(\begin{array}{c}\frac{p}{1 - p}\end{array}\right)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n
$$

--

- We can solve for _p_:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p & = \mbox{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n) \\ & \\
& = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

---

layout: true

# "The" effect is nonlinear in _p_

$$
\begin{aligned}
p & = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

# Probabilities relative to a baseline

-  Problem with probabilities: change in percentage points depends on baseline starting value

--

- We can choose an appropriate baseline probability, then compute the marginal effect of a predictor given that baseline

--

- Options for baseline:

--

  - Model intercept

--

  - Observed outcome % in dataset (similar to intercept if continuous predictors are centered and other coefficients aren't too large)

--

  - Observed outcome % for a certain group (e.g., students with no tutoring)

--

  - Some % that's meaningful in context (e.g., 85% pass rate in typical years)

---

# Probabilities relative to a baseline

- Baseline probability: inverse logit of the intercept

$$p_0 = \mbox{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0)$$

--

- Probability with discrete predictor $i$: inverse logit of intercept + predictor coefficient

$$p_i = \mbox{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_i)$$

--

- For a continuous predictor $j$, pick a change in predictor value that makes sense

--

  - One standard deviation

--

  - A context-specific benchmark (e.g., 1 point for GPA, 100 points on the SAT)

--

$$p_j = \mbox{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_j\Delta x_j)$$

--

- To show uncertainty, get confidence interval before inverse logit transformation

# Visualization family 3:

# Counterfactual counts

---

# Extra successes

- Sometimes stakeholders are interested in **the number of times something happens (or doesn't happen)**

--

- Example: stakeholders want to assess the impact of tutoring on pass rates in Balloon Animal-Making 201

--

  - They're interested not just in _whether_ tutoring helps students, but _how much_ it helps them

--

  - In our dataset, `r format(sum(df$tutoring), big.mark = ",")` students received tutoring; of those, `r format(sum(df$tutoring & df$passed), big.mark = ",")` passed the class

--

  - Suppose those students had _not_ received tutoring; in that case, how many would have passed? 

--

  - In other words, how many "extra" passes did we get because of tutoring?

---

# Extra successes

- To get a point estimate:

--

  - Take all students who received tutoring

--

  - Set `tutoring` to `FALSE` instead of `TRUE`

--

  - Use the model to make (counterfactual) predictions for the revised dataset

--

  - Count predicted counterfactual passes; compare to the actual number of passes

--

- We can get confidence intervals by simulating many sets of outcomes and aggregating over them.

- Knowing your stakeholders as well as the context and purpose of your research should be your guides to determine which visualization is most appropriate
